# Breaking changes

With the release of `v.0.43`, extensive changes were made to the default settings of the analyzer, and dependencies on
libraries that are difficult to install (e.g., Detectron2) were reduced. In addition, the documentation has been
thoroughly revised, which also includes a reduction in the number of executable Jupyter notebooks.
