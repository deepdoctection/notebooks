    "```yaml\n",
    "USE_LAYOUT: True\n",
    "\n",
    "USE_TABLE_SEGMENTATION: True   # this will determine cells and rows/column of a detected table\n",

    "## Layout models\n",
    "\n",
    "Layout detection uses either Tensorpack's Cascade-RCNN or Detectron2 Cascade-RCNN by default, depending on which DL framework PyTorch or Tensorflow has been installed. The model have been trained on Publaynet and therefore provide detection of one of the following segments: `text, title, table, figure, list`. You can filter any of the segments, e.g.\n",

    "A custom model can be added as well, but it needs to be registered. The same holds true for some special categories. We refer to [this notebook](./Running_pre_trained_models_from_third_party_libraries.ipynb) for adding your own or third party models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Table segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Table segmentation, e.g. the determination of cells, rows and columns as well as multi-span cells can be done in two different ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "*The original **deep**doctection process*: With one cell detector and one row-column detector each, the basis for the table structure is created. Then, by superimposing cells to rows and columns, the row and column number of the cell is determined. This admittedly rather short description should not hide the fact that this derivation consists of many intermediate steps. Row and column numbers must be stretched to completely overlay the table. If necessary, some overlapping rows and columns must be removed. An overlay rule of cells to rows and columns must be set, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "*The Table Transformer process*: Here, rows and columns as well as multi-spanning cells are detected in only one detector. In contrast to the process proposed in the original repo, cells are simply detected by overlapping rows and columns. Then it is looked which of the simple cells can be replaced by multi-spanning cells. In a last step, the row and column number of a cell is determined. \n",
    "\n",
    "Table transformer is only available with PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default configuration uses the **deep**doctection process.\n",

    "  STRETCH_RULE: equal  # how to stretch row/columns: left is another choice\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule of thumb for the configuration of the segmentation the following can be stated: The better the detectors work for the use case, the higher the thresholds should be chosen to leverage the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform table segmentation with Table transformer, the configuration must be set as follows:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In our own experience, it has been shown that the recognition of multi spanning cells does not work reliably for tables that do not originate from medical articles. If you can do without determining multi-spanning cells/headers, it is recommended to filter them.\n",
