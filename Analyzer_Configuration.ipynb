    "When it comes to commercial providers, this remains speculative. In the open-source domain, however, there are already several very promising approaches. **deep**doctection, however, follows the strategy of combining smaller models with rule-based processing steps. The advantage of this approach is that it relies on smaller models, which are easier to fine-tune, and that individual processing steps can be adjusted through configuration.\n",

    "In this notebook, we aim to take a closer look at the configuration and show how components can be activated and models can be exchanged. The configuration options are extensive, and changes in some areas often require adjustments in others. It is not possible to cover all configuration options in this context. For further details, we refer to the comments in the source code.\n",

    "## Table Segmentation in **deep**doctection\n",
    "\n",
    "Table segmentation — i.e., the detection of cells, rows, columns, and multi-spanning cells — can be performed using two different approaches in **deep**doctection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Original deepdoctection Process\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original method, table structure is constructed using two separate models: one for detecting cells and another for detecting rows and columns. Once these components are detected, the row and column indices of each cell are assigned based on how cells spatially overlap with the detected rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this description may sound straightforward, the underlying logic involves several intermediate steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Row and column regions must be “stretched” to fully cover the table.\n",
    "* Overlapping rows or columns that create ambiguity must be removed.\n",
    "* Specific rules for assigning cells to rows and columns must be applied, based on overlap criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Table Transformer Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from release **v0.34**, the default method for table segmentation is the **Table Transformer** approach. This model handles the detection of rows, columns, and multi-spanning cells in a single step. Moreover, the model is able to detect column header, projected row header and projected column headers. Cells are formed by intersecting the detected rows and columns. In a subsequent refinement step, simple (non-spanning) cells may be replaced with multi-spanning cells where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, each cell is assigned its row and column number.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Table Transformer is only available with **PyTorch**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we have observed that the recognition of multi-spanning cells is **less reliable** for non-scientific tables (e.g., tables not originating from medical articles). If multi-spanning headers are not essential, we recommend filtering them out. The result is a table structure consisting only of simple cells, i.e., cells with `row_span = 1` and `column_span = 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The segmentation configuration is extensive, and we cannot cover every setting in detail. For a comprehensive description of all parameters, we refer to the source code. We will focus on the parameters that have the most significant impact on the segmentation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "SEGMENTATION:\n",
    "  ASSIGNMENT_RULE: ioa  # iou is another cell/row/column overlapping rule\n",
    "  FULL_TABLE_TILING: true  # in order to guarantee that the table is completely covered with rows and columns\n",
    "  REMOVE_IOU_THRESHOLD_COLS: 0.2 # Removes overlapping rows based on an IoU threshold.\n",
    "# Helps prevent multiple row spans caused by overlapping detections.\n",
    "# Note: for better alignment, SEGMENTATION.FULL_TABLE_TILING can be enabled.\n",
    "# Using a low threshold here may result in a very coarse grid.\n",
    "  REMOVE_IOU_THRESHOLD_ROWS: 0.2\n",
    "  STRETCH_RULE: equal  # how to stretch row/columns: left is another choice\n",
    "  THRESHOLD_COLS: 0.4 # Threshold for assigning a (special) cell to a row based on the chosen rule (IOU or IOA).\n",
    "# The row assignment is based on the highest-overlapping row.\n",
    "# Multiple overlaps can lead to increased rowspan.\n",
    "  THRESHOLD_ROWS: 0.4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guidance:** The more accurate the underlying detectors are for your specific use case, the higher the thresholds (e.g., `THRESHOLD_ROWS`, `THRESHOLD_COLS`) should be set to take full advantage of the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filtering Redundant Detections\n",
    "\n",
    "The Table Transformer may detect redundant table structures and headers. To filter those out, apply the following:\n",

    "```yaml\n",

    "## Word matching\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Word matching serves to merge the results of layout analysis (including table structure) with those of OCR. Up to this point, all layout segments and words are independent elements of a page, with no established relationships between them. Word matching creates a link between each word and the appropriate layout segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most effective way to establish this link is by evaluating the spatial overlap between a word and layout segments. It must be clearly defined which layout segments are eligible for such associations — not all segments are suitable. For example, words that are part of a table should not be linked to the table's outer frame, but rather to the individual cell identified during table segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration below defines the layout segments that can be directly linked to words. Using the `RULE` parameter — either *intersection-over-area* (`ioa`) or *intersection-over-union* (`iou`) — you can specify the logic for determining whether a relationship should be established. If the overlap exceeds the given `THRESHOLD`, a connection is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible for a word to overlap with multiple layout segments. In such cases, setting `MAX_PARENT_ONLY = True` ensures that the word is only assigned to the segment with the highest overlap score.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In the final step of the pipeline, words and layout segments must be arranged to form coherent, continuous text. This task is handled by the `TextOrderService` component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Words that have been assigned to layout segments are grouped into lines, which are then read from top to bottom. To sort layout segments effectively, auxiliary columns are constructed. These columns are further grouped into **contiguous blocks** that vertically span the page. The reading order is then determined by traversing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* columns within a block from **left to right**, and\n",
    "* contiguous blocks from **top to bottom**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![pipelines](./pics/dd_connected_blocks.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to note that this method imposes an **artificial reading order**, which may not align with the true semantic structure of more complex or unconventional layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, if layout detection is imprecise, the resulting reading order may be flawed. This is a known limitation and should always be kept in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TextOrderService` can be configured using four key parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `TEXT_CONTAINER`: defines the category containing textual elements, such as `word`. Technically speaking, a text container is an `ImageAnnotation` with the subcategory `<WordType.CHARACTERS>`. In most cases, this refers to individual words. However, there are also OCR systems that return their results line by line, using the layout type `<LayoutType.LINE>`.\n",
    "* `TEXT_ORDERING.TEXT_BLOCK_CATEGORIES`: lists the layout segments to which words have been assigned and which should be ordered. In general you should list layout segments that have been added to `TEXT_ORDERING.WORD_MATCHING.PARENTAL_CATEGORIES`.  \n",
    "* `TEXT_ORDERING.FLOATING_TEXT_BLOCK_CATEGORIES`: defines segments that are not part of the main document flow but should still be considered (e.g., footnotes or side notes). A common question is whether tables should be part of the main body text—by default, they are excluded.\n",
    "* `TEXT_ORDERING.INCLUDE_RESIDUAL_TEXT_CONTAINER`: controls whether *orphan words* (those not assigned to any layout segment) should be included in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s revisit the topic of **orphan words**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the word matching process it is possible that some words do not overlap with any layout segment. \n",
    "If `INCLUDE_RESIDUAL_TEXT_CONTAINER` is set to `False`, these words will not receive a `reading_order` and will be excluded from the text output.\n",
    "If set to `True`, orphan words are grouped into `line`s and included in the output, ensuring no text is lost. This setting is often crucial and may need to be adjusted depending on your use case. We already covered this topic in the [**More_on_parsing notebook**](./Analyzer_More_On_Parsing.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
